/**
 * Core interface for an offline speech-to-text engine. Implementations run entirely on-device
 * against bundled models — the app has no network.
 *
 * **Contract:**
 * - All methods are safe to call from any coroutine; internal synchronization is the engine's job.
 * - [transcribe] and [transcribeStream] suspend until the result is available.
 * - [transcribeStream] emits [SttResult]s as audio is processed (partial then final); the last
 *   emission with [SttResultType.FINAL] is the committed transcription.
 * - [release] is idempotent; calling methods after [release] throws [SttException.EngineNotReady].
 * - Implementations must follow the project's graceful-degradation pattern: if the model cannot be
 *   loaded, [transcribe] returns [SttResult.empty] rather than throwing. Only truly unexpected
 *   failures throw [SttException].
 *
 * **Audio format:** all engines accept 16-bit signed PCM, mono, at [SttLanguage.SAMPLE_RATE] (16 kHz).
 * The caller is responsible for capturing audio in this format. See [SttConfig.sampleRate].
 *
 * **Thread safety:** implementations may be called from multiple coroutines concurrently. The engine
 * serializes inference internally (the [Mutex]-behind-[runCatching] pattern from
 * [app.swarsetu.moderation.MlTextModerator]).
 *
 * **Lifecycle:**
 * 1. Created by [SttEngineFactory] (or via Koin DI).
 * 2. [initialize] loads the model for the configured language.
 * 3. [transcribe] or [transcribeStream] processes audio.
 * 4. [release] frees model memory and native resources.
 *
 * This interface is intentionally Knit-agnostic: it knows nothing about the mesh, the wire format,
 * or the application layer. The application (ViewModel / MeshManager) calls this interface and
 * handles the result.
